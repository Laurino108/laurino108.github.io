            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to social media, I'm definitely more a reader than a writer type of person.
Recently I've felt a need to start creating content. Or, more like get back into doing it.</p><p>Actually i never had a blog so yeah why not to start one yet?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-yet-another-blog">Why yet another blog<a class="hash-link" href="#why-yet-another-blog" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Nowadays, everyone has their own blog. Do I really need to become another wannabe influencer?</p><p>No. What I want to achieve is:</p><ul><li>structure my knowledge and record what I've learned recently,</li><li>try out new ways to increase productivity, stay motivated and avoid burnout,</li><li>improve my English (as a non-native English speaker),</li><li>develop self-discipline, reduce procrastination, and, as a result, save time to do the things mentioned above.</li></ul><p>So, as you can see, it's mostly for me, but I hope you'll benefit from this as well.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-to-expect">What to expect<a class="hash-link" href="#what-to-expect" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Well, definitely shorter, more concise blog posts, like this one.</p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.tenor.com/UqpAOVgDfaMAAAAC/we-dont-have-time-for-this-the-encore.gif" width="220" height="220" class="img_ev3q"><p>source: <a href="https://tenor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenor</a></p><p>While I have a few ideas for new blog posts in mind, I don't want to limit myself to just technical topics. Instead, I will probably touch on different areas of my interest, such as:</p><ul><li>full-stack technical topics related to the technologies I use</li><li>personal projects announcements,</li><li>new talks announcements</li><li>open source,</li><li>cool projects and apps I stumbled upon,</li><li>productivity,</li><li>personal growth (i.e. soft skills),</li></ul><p>Yup, that's a lot - but we'll see how it goes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing-words">Closing Words<a class="hash-link" href="#closing-words" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>If you got to this point, then congratulations. ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to my blog.</p><p>Thanks for reading see you and bye ðŸ‘‹</p>]]></content:encoded>
