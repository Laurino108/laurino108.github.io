Do I really need to become another wannabe influencer?\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. What I want to achieve is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- structure my knowledge and record what I\'ve learned recently,\\r\\n- try out new ways to increase productivity, stay motivated and avoid burnout,\\r\\n- improve my English (as a non-native English speaker),\\r\\n- develop self-discipline, reduce procrastination, and, as a result, save time to do the things mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, as you can see, it\'s mostly for me, but I hope you\'ll benefit from this as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What to expect\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, definitely shorter, more concise blog posts, like this one.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://media.tenor.com/UqpAOVgDfaMAAAAC/we-dont-have-time-for-this-the-encore.gif\\" width=\\"220\\" height=\\"220\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\nsource: [tenor](https://tenor.com)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I have a few ideas for new blog posts in mind, I don\'t want to limit myself to just technical topics.
